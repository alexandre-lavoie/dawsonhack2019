## Sprint 1 - Hardware Design

TBA

## Sprint 2 - Hardware Testing

Use of Serial for data reading. Voltmeter?

* Electronics - Test if pins work correctly, voltage is as expected, and using the correct hardware.
* Sensors - Test ultrasonic accuracy / delays.
* Servos - Test rotation accuracy. Add calibration for uneven servos.

## Sprint 3 - Basic Software

* Servos - Forward/backward movement, left/right turning.
* Sensors - Gets accurate distance when moving forwards.

## Sprint 4 - Algorithm

TBA

## Sprint 5 - Hardware/Software Cleanup
